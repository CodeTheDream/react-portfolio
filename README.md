# react-portfolio

Hi. Welcome to your Portfolio assignment. This one is a little bit different than the last. We want you to build your new portfolio and then deploy it with Netlify so that it can live on the web. Additionally, when you are ready to start coding this application we want you to fork it from your resume project and build on that. Here's the instructions.

1. Find between 3 & 5 portfolios that you really like. [Here](https://www.creativebloq.com/portfolios/examples-712368) is one place you can start if you need some inpsiration. Take note of what you like specifically about them and how you can incorporate some of that into your own portfolio.
2. Create a wireframe. 
3. Set up a meeting time with Tom on Slack to discuss your portfolio project. 
4. Create a mock up using Figma or other design tool. 
5. Fork your resume project and build it.
6. Deploy to Netlify.
